* in fmpq_poly_rem_powers_precomp, use precomputed powers in cases where
  m >= 2*n - 1

qfb
---

* Cubing version of NUCOMP (NUCUBE)
* Pow which makes use of NUDUPL and NUCUBE

nf_elem

  by full denominators

* fix nf_elem_print to print consistent format

* add nf_elem_print_pretty ?

* special powering code for quadratic fields
